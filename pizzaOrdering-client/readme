========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch03-client (main project directory)
      --- app  - contains all the  modules that will consume the API from ch03
               - contains the __init__.py - the heart of the applications
                     - contains all the initialization, setups, and   
                          configurations
                     - creates the Flask instance and returns it to main.py
              
      --- main.py -  the main module that imports the create_app() from 
          modules/__init__.py 

      --- log_msg.txt.i - log files generated by the logger

B. Configuration files 
    config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage

C. Dependencies
   --- Use the ch03-env of the ch03 project
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
